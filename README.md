# customCMPdb: Customize and Query Compound Annotation Database

## Introduction
This package is served as the query and customization interface for compound 
annotations from [DrugAge](https://genomics.senescence.info/drugs/), 
[DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/), [CMAP02](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) 
and [LINCS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742) databases.
It also stores the structure SDF datasets for compounds in the above four databases.


Specifically, the annotation database created by this package is an SQLite database
containing 5 tables, including 4 compound annotation tables from DrugAge, 
DrugBank, CMAP02 and LINCS databases, respectively. 
The other one is an ID mapping table of ChEMBL IDs to IDs of 
individual databases. The other 4 datasets stores the structures of compounds 
in the DrugAge, DrugBank, CMAP02 and LINCS databases in SDF files. For detailed 
description of the 5 datasets generated by this package, please consult to the
[vignette](https://github.com/yduan004/customCMPdb/tree/master/vignettes). 
The actual datasets are hosted in the `AnnotationHub`. 

This package also provides functionalities to customize and query the compound
annotation SQLite database. Users could add their customized compound annotation
tables to the SQLite database and query both the default (DrugAge, DrugBank, CMAP02,
LINCS) and customized annotations by providing ChEMBL ids of the query compounds.

## Installation and Loading
`customCMPdb` is an R/Bioconductor package and can be installed using 
`BiocManager::install()`.
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
